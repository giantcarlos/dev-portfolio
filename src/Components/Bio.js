      <p>Manila-born, Texas-based software engineer with a background in Fashion Merchandising. I bring a technical mindset and a keen eye for aesthetics and UI/UX design to my work. While I'm trained as a full-stack developer, my true passion lies in front-end development, where I can combine my love for coding and design.</p>
      <p>Beyond the world of code, I am a former touring musician turned local Dallas DJ. A dedicated long-distance runner with four Dallas Marathon finishes, currently gearing up for the fifth. During downtime, I indulge in Dungeons & Dragons and Magic: The Gathering, as I value the creativity and social connections these games foster.</p>
