      <p>Manila-born, Texas-based software engineer with a background in Fashion Merchandising. I bring a technical mindset and a keen eye for aesthetics and UI/UX design to my work. While I'm trained as a full-stack developer, my true passion lies in front-end development, where I can combine my love for coding and design.</p>
      <p>Beyond the world of code, I find solace in music. Having toured as a musician in my youth, I now DJ in the local Dallas area, allowing me to stay connected to my musical roots. On top of that, I'm an avid long-distance runner, having completed the Dallas Marathon four times and currently training for my fifth.</p>
      <p>In my downtime, you'll often find me engaging in paper/tabletop gaming. Dungeons & Dragons and Magic: The Gathering are my preferred choices, as I value the creativity and social connections these games foster.</p>
